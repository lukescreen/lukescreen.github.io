					<h2>Thing you might not know about allistics.</h2>
					<p>
						Allistic Disorder is a spectrum condition so just how
						severely affected by the condition someone is varies
						greatly.
					</p>
					<p>
						It affects 99 out of 100 people in the UK. allistics are
						very different from one another, when you have met one
						allistic you have met one allistic. Everyone is an
						individual. No two people with the condition are the
						same. Everyone is unique in their own beautiful way.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are no known treatments for allistic disorder, and
						so there is no cure. A lot of allistics feel they don’t
						need a cure and want acceptance and understanding.
					</p>
					<p>
						No one really knows what causes allistic disorder,
						however there are a lot of theories. Some suggest it may
						be due to diet. Others say they have completely ordinary
						genes with nothing special or unique in their DNA.
					</p>
					<p>
						You rarely get over allistic disorder. It is a lifetime
						condition.
					</p>
					<p>
						People with the disorder speak in code. They say one
						thing, but mean something completely different. They use
						strange body language to communicate to each other. They
						sign e-mails with kisses. Yet, if you go to kiss them
						next time you see them they are freaked out. It of
						course makes sense that they are freaked out by kisses
						in real life but what doesn’t make sense is why it (not
						only seems to be accepted over the internet, but) the
						expected thing to do. What we need to do is learn to
						accept this inconsistent behaviour from allistics,
						because it is part of their condition not to think so
						logically.
					</p>
					<p>
						Allistics may ask unnecessary questions that they don’t
						want an honest answer to. They might ask, “Do I look
						fat?” And they want you to answer ‘No’. Those of us who
						don’t suffer from the condition know that it’s pointless
						to ask a question if you’re not going to accept the
						truth but allistics struggle to understand this concept.
					</p>
					<p>
						Peope with Allistic Disorder like eye contact. Yes! Can
						you believe it? They like to stair directly into your
						eyes when they talk to you, which might make you feel
						uncomfortable, but we need to make allowances for their
						social differences. Many people with the disorder may
						even feel that you are dishonest if you don’t give them
						eye contact.
					</p>
					<p>
						Allistics like playing really loud music and dancing
						around doing strange stereotypical movements. The name
						they give for this movement is ‘clubbing it’. Some
						allistics say that this behaviour helps them to relax
						after a hard days working. Why this behaviour helps them
						is a great mystery to those of us who don’t suffer from
						the disorder and I suppose we’ll never understand for
						sure. It has been suggested that therapy could be used
						to help them find a more socially acceptable way to
						relieve pressure.
					</p>
					<p>
						Allistics can be very obsessive and rule-based. For
						example, they may believe no one should wear shirts that
						are creased. They may even be obsessive about the way
						you hold a knife and fork, insisting it has to be a set
						way.
					</p>
					<p>
						In severe cases of allistic disorder; you may find that
						individuals will shelve books or DVDs in a really
						disorganised way. They may even place books upside down
						and have a series all muddled up. They can’t help it.
						They just don’t know any better. They’re simply unable
						to notice these mistakes that the rest of us take for
						granted.
					</p>
					<p>
						One very common trait of the disorder is to say some
						illogical things, like claiming their dog is the best
						dog in the world, which honestly makes no sense because
						they clearly haven’t met every dog on the planet so how
						can they possibly know?
					</p>
					<p style="font-style: italic">
						Warning * Some people with the condition find the term
						allistic offensive. Many people prefer to say omething
						like, “I am a person who has allistic disorder”, because
						they don’t want the condition to define them (they want
						to be seen as a person first). Others prefer to say, “I
						am an allistic person” because they see the disorder as
						a part of who they are, and it shouldn’t be considered
						separate from them. Others prefer to describe themselves
						as ‘Neurotypicas’, but this term isn’t as specific as
						the term ‘allistic’. There are others who say they don’t
						like labels. Be careful what words you use when
						addressing allistics. Perhaps it would be better to just
						use their names and refer to them as people. I am also
						aware that not every single allistic person necessarily
						relates to all of the traits brought up in this article
						and not all people who do relate to it will be allistic;
						it’s very much a generalisation.
					</p>
					<p style="font-weight: 400">
						This article is said in jest I am friends with a lot of
						allistics, and a lot of my family are allistic and so no
						insult is intended. I just thought, since we read a lot
						about autistics, it would be fun to turn the tables for
						a laugh.
