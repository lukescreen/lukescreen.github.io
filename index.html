		<h1 id="the-work-good-method">The Work Good Method</h1>
		<p>
			The Work Good method is composed of two techniques.<br />
			They are; the Animedoro Timer, and the Shitty Draft.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 id="animedoro">Animedoro</h2>
		<p>
			The Animedoro Timer is a time stucture that balances Studies and
			Anime.<br />
			Its goal is to give the most gratification most work.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>40-60 mins of work.</li>
			<li>1 short episode of any show.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="timings">Timings</h3>
		<p>
			It's important to let the natural breaks/gaps in study occur.<br />
			This means breaks are taken at the end of sections or pieces of
			work.<br />
			That's why the working range is 40-60 minutes; as long as your are
			inside that range, you can take your break.
		</p>
		<h3 id="why-is-this-better-than-pomodoro">
			Why is this better than Pomodoro?
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The work period for Pomodoro is 25 minutes.<br />
				This doesn't give much time to complete a task when settling
				down is considered.
			</li>
			<li>
				The 20 minute range of Animedoro also allows for work to flow
				naturally.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Pomodoro's rest period is only 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>
				That's definitely not long enough to do anything
				rewarding/satisfying.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<hr />
		<h2 id="the-shitty-draft">The Shitty Draft</h2>
		<p>
			The goal of the shitty draft is to brute force as much work as
			possible.
		</p>
		<h3 id="how-does-it-prevent-procrastination">
			How does it prevent procrastination?
		</h3>
		<p>
			The easier the work feels, the less likely you are to procrastinate
			from doing it.<br />
			Making the groundwork feels like getting more work done.<br />
			Going back and editing that gives the same gratification once it is
			finished.
		</p>
		<h3 id="the-second-pass">The Second Pass</h3>
		<p>
			When you are doing the work properly on the second pass, it is just
			editing existing work.<br />
			That helps you not get tired because it feels like easier work.
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;<em>I need to answer the last half.</em>&quot; becomes
			&quot;<em>I need to edit my answers in the last half.</em>&quot;
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>
		<p>
			This method won't make you hyper-productive, but it will hopefully
			help you enjoy studying a bit more.<br />
			The only way to succeed is to work hard.<br />
			You could just watch anime, but you need to have the willpower to be
			proactive and thus productive.
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;<em>Talent is a pursued interest. In other words,</em><br />
			<em>anything that you're willing to practice, you can do.</em
